### Hi there 👋, I am Trout 🐟. Minä olen Trout

I love and majorly working daily with C++ in the game industry starting from Jan, 2008.

For long, I was mainly a UnrealEngine developer from 2008 till 2024. Also learned some professional CryENGINE 3 in 2013, and a bit playing with Unity3D in 2009 and 2017.

Now I start to do in-house engine development and support, especially in platform area.

I don't do open source development, but for those open source projects I use, I will contribute back if I can, hence those depot I cloned, are majorly for PR purpose.
