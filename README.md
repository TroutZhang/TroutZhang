### Hi there 👋, I am Trout 🐟.

I love C++, and I use it daily for my work in the game industry.

I can also program in some other C-family language, i.e., C/C#/Python/Swift/Javascript/Java/Object-C when needed. (the order matters ~ 😁)

I have been using UnrealEngine(3,4,5) most of the time and have some CryENGINE 3 experience.

I don't like Unity3D, and I don't have any deep experience working with it.
